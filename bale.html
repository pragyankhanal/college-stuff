            <h1>Dark Knight Trilogy</h1>
            <h3><i>"Why so serious"</i></h3>
            <p>The "Dark Knight" trilogy isn't just the best superhero trilogy but the best trilogy ever.
            <br>Cristopher Nolan is the man who is responsible for this masterpiece. He is known for great cinematography,
            <br>and he shows it off in this trilogy too. Cristian Bale is so flawless as both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
            <br>The story of this trilogy is taken straight out of the comics into the big screen. There are all sorts of
            <br>villians like Joker, Two Face, Ra's al Ghul, Bane.
            <br>The actor who persued Joker, Heath Ledger, won an oscar for his role as well.

            <h2>Aims</h2>

            <p style="text-align: left; ">
                For this project these were my aims were as follows:<br>
                1. To gain knowledge about basics of building a website.<br>
                2. To learn about the functionality of a website.<br>
                3. To learn GIT and make use of it properly.<br>
                4. To test my HTML and CSS skills.<br>

            </p>
            <p>This page is about the research I have done for doing this project or say about making this website.
                As this is my first time making a webpage and using CSS and HTML I had some problems at the beginning.<br>
                I didn't even have any idea what to make the webpage look like let alone starting to make one.
                But, from the help of my tutor and the internet I got an idea about it. 
                I then imagined the page I wanted to make and the page required. 
                Then, I started surfing the internet looking for the design, looking for the inspiration for my webpage. 
                After a long period of looking through almost all the websites I could find, I then set-up my mind and started making one.
                All that time later I finally made up my mind about the looks of the website I wanted to make and this is the result.</p>

        <p>P.S-In some code images of the webpage the top part which containts the code for navigation bar is not shown<br>
        because it is the same code for all pages. Also showing that part of the code didn't have space for the bottom part<br>
        which has the important codes.</p>

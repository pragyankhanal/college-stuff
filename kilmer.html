            <h1>Batman Forever</h1>
            <h3><i>"Why can't you just die ?"</i></h3>
            <p>This movie was the first movie which displayed the character development of Bruce Wayne as well as Batman.
            <br>For its time it was really good with amazing VFX and soundtrack. It has two villians, Joker and Two Face,
            <br>working against Batman. WB chose Joel Schumacher as the directer of this movie but his idea made this movie
            <br>lose the potential it has. As of now "Batman Forver" is one of the most horrible Batman movie ever made.
